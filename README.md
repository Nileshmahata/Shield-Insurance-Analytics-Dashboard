## 🧾 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world client assignment for a fictional company — **Shield Insurance**.

As a **Data Analyst**, my task was to design a Power BI dashboard that helps the company:
- Understand revenue and customer performance
- Analyze sales trends by city, age group, and channel
- Identify best-performing policies and weak spots (e.g., settlement issues)
- Enable interactive exploration through filters and visuals

✔️ Track total customers and revenue over time  
✔️ Identify city-wise and age-wise performance  
✔️ Compare online vs offline sales mode  
✔️ Analyze month-wise trends for sales mode and age group  
✔️ Highlight top policies by revenue & customer count  
✔️ Evaluate claim settlement behavior across age groups  
✔️ Empower managers with dynamic filters (slicers)
